Getting started:
To use the library, include the skilltree.js file.
The library is meant to aid in the creation of skill trees.
To start using the library, create a TreeGenerator Object, and use its methods to generate the tree, create and generate nodes (skill container/objects) and the connections between them (learning relationships).
